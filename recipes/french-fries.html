    <h2>French fries are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium and France.</h2>
    <p>French fries are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep
        fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely used, and sometimes baked in a regular or
        convection oven; air fryers are small convection ovens marketed for frying potatoes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>6 Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into thick fries</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spray with
            cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Place sliced potatoes in a colander; sprinkle sugar over potatoes. Set aside until liquid is released from
            potatoes, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain liquid and dry potatoes well.</li>
        <li>Mix potato slices, olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a resealable plastic bag until evenly
            coated. Spread coated potato slices in a single layer, leaving space around each potato, on the prepared
            baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes; flip fries and continue baking until crisp and browned, about 20
            more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
